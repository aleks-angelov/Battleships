# Battleships

### Individual class project for COS 231 - Introduction to UNIX (Spring 2015)

##### Description:
The goal of this project was to implement a single player version of the popular Battleships game for the UNIX shell, using the Python 2 scripting language. In this turn-based classic game, two players place several ships on a large board and take turns trying to pinpoint the location of the opponentâ€™s ships. The objective of the game is to be the first to mark all the ships of the other player. Completing the project required about twelve hours of design, implementation, and testing. It features extensive input validation, which prevents the script from crashing at runtime.
